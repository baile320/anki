# Introduction
These are my anki decks. Anki is a flashcard software that uses spaced repetition to help you learn.

## Decks

### Rust - Methods and Functions

This deck contains most of the methods I thought were important for data structures in std and std::collections. It's missing a lot of the methods that do byte stuff, pointer stuff, and it doesn't always have every variation (good example: it has as_chunks but not as_chunks_mut, as_chunks_unchecked, as_chunks_unchecked_mut for slices).
### Refactoring

Anki cards from the book (2nd edition) by Martin Fowler.
